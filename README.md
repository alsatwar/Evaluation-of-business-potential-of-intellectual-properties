# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-approach-for-evaluating-business-potential-of-intellectual-properties

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been phenomenal in predictive analytics of business problems. This study paved to compute business potential of individual patents using Feed-Forward-Neural Network algorithm to predict the likelihood of a patent to survive until its maximum expiration date. The binary classification is named as Core-Business-Patents (CBPs) and Non-Core-Business-Patents (Non-CBPs). This project aimed to aid businesses identifying their business potential of intellectual properties, because patents are retained when profits created are larger than the maintenance fee, finding emerging technologies of competitive firms. A total of 31 indicators and maintenance fee data was used for learning a FFNN model.

the business potential of a patent was evaluated based on the prediction result regarding the likelihood that a patent survives until its maximum expiration date. this approach adjusted the threshold t of the patent’s business potential value to address the business potential from various viewpoints. Indeed, the performance of a decision system can be analyzed from multiple viewpoints by adjusting the threshold for determining the positive/negative state of a predicted value.
